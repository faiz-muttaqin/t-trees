T-trees: Privacy policy

Welcome to the T-trees app for Android!

This is an free Android app developed by Faiz Muttaqin. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I just programmed this app for auth, using Firebase Authentication, just to check if the user has a login or not, then show data from our database. Nothing personal information from every user that we collect. We just need permission for file and media access just for downloading photos of tree photos to your device nothing else.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email. I will surely try to fix it/help you.


Yours sincerely,
Faiz Muttaqin.
